      The interactive visualization we made answers the following question:
      <em
        >How do daily and hourly activity levels vary by male and female
        mice?</em
      >
      Understanding gender differences in mouse activity will help us learn how
      hormones and biological factors shape behavior, which is critical for
      research on health and treatments. This exploration helps answer how
      hormones and gender can affect behavior and how mice can be used to study
      human health conditions.
      <br /><br />
      Our visualization compares the activity levels of male and female mice,
      illustrating both the daily and hourly fluctuations. It also highlights
      the estrus periods during the 14 days, in order to explore how
      reproductive cycles or hormonal changes can influence activity levels of
      female mice.
      <br /><br />
      The visualization we made is two-part: it includes a main, bigger plot
      that illustrates the daily trends of activity levels of male and female
      mice, and the smaller plot to the bottom right that illustrates the hourly
      activity level fluctuations of male and female mice. There is a slider
      below the smaller plot that allows the viewer to interact with the
      visualization and control the day they wish to observe. The data we used
      to create this visualization came from the provided mouse dataset. In
      order to generate the data values used in the big and small line plots, we
      wrangled the data by averaging the activity levels for male and female
      mice per day and per hour.
      <br /><br />
      Our interactive visualization uses numerous visual encoding techniques to
      present the data in a clear, evocative, and effective way. The first set
      of interactive features we incorporated were regarding hovering over the
      line plots. Hovering over any given day/hour will result in the points for
      the corresponding day/hour being larger in size, a dashed line going
      through the points marking the day/hour, and a tooltip that would display
      the day/hour and its specific corresponding male and female activity
      levels next to the cursor. The reasoning behind these visual encodings is
      simple: the larger points would make it clear which points the
      viewer&apos;s cursor is currently over, the dashed line makes it clear the
      corresponding day/hour, and the tooltip gives the specific values for male
      and female activity levels for the viewers use. In addition to hovering,
      another interactive element we incorporated was a slider element below the
      smaller plot, which would show the hourly activity levels for mice.
      Adjusting the slider would adjust the day for which the graph would be
      shown for. This would also adjust the corresponding highlight on the
      larger graph, which shows what day is being looked at. The highlight is
      red for days of estrus and yellow for days without estrus. The reason
      these colors were chosen is because red represents something
      characteristic of a female, as estrus is, while yellow-orange would do
      well as a mild color to represent a normal day. Likewise, the colors
      chosen for the graph were blue and pink to intuitively represent the male
      and female genders. Furthermore, because the line graphs are set on the
      same scale and represent “Activity Level,” it employs a position on a
      common scale visual channel. This makes the visualization expressive and
      allows the viewer to quickly compare the activity levels between males and
      females, on both the plots. Lastly, the interactive slider enables the
      viewer to obtain more data and information regarding the question, as
      it&apos;s aggregated by the hour, instead of by each day.
      <br /><br />
      Some alternatives we considered include a scatter plot instead of a line
      plot, and using raw data instead of aggregating it by hour or by day. We
      eliminated these ideas because they would be too overwhelming for the
      viewer to digest too much data at once. We chose to do a two-plot layout
      so that viewers can visualize both the daily average activity levels and
      also the hourly fluctuations side-by-side. We chose line plots because
      they make it easy to track and compare how activity levels change over
      time for both male and female mice. Daily and hourly views can provide a
      more complete picture — daily shows the overall trends and while hourly
      captures the smaller fluctuations, like their nocturnal activity.
      <br /><br />
      Through these interactive elements, the viewer should be able to explore
      and notice interesting patterns. For example, through the red highlight
      marking days of estrus, we can notice that females have a spike in
      activity levels, and relatively higher activity levels compared to male
      mice. Moreover, the hourly activity levels as depicted in the small
      interactive slider plot illustrates how mice are more active during early
      hours of the day because they are nocturnal.
      <br /><br />
      The work was distributed evenly within the group in the completion of this
      project. For the checkpoint, we gathered ideas and collectively generated
      5 plots before settling on the best idea to make an interactive
      visualization with. Afterwards, we collectively brainstormed for 20
      minutes to decide the interactive element to incorporate into our
      visualization. We then worked on each part – main code, styling, and write
      up – together. One person was in charge of each section, but we would
      collectively work on it and offer help and inputs. This project roughly
      took 18 hours combined, and the aspect that took the most time was the
      coding in D3. We would consult ChatGPT and Copilot as needed to streamline
      this process.
